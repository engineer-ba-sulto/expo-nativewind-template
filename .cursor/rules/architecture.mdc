# アーキテクチャ原則 (ARCHITECTURE)

## File Length and Structure

- Never allow a file to exceed 500 lines.
- If a file approaches 400 lines, break it up immediately.
- Treat 1000 lines as unacceptable, even temporarily.
- Use folders and naming conventions to keep small files logically grouped.

## OOP First

- Every functionality should be in a dedicated class, struct, or protocol, even if it's small.
- Favor composition over inheritance, but always use object-oriented thinking.
- Code must be built for reuse, not just to "make it work."

## Single Responsibility Principle

- Every file, class, and function should do one thing only.
- If it has multiple responsibilities, split it immediately.
- Each view, manager, or utility should be laser-focused on one concern.

## Modular Design

- Code should connect like Lego - interchangeable, testable, and isolated.
- Ask: "Can I reuse this class in a different screen or project?" If not, refactor it.
- Reduce tight coupling between components. Favor dependency injection or protocols.

## Function and Class Size

- Keep functions under 30-40 lines.
- If a class is over 200 lines, assess splitting into smaller helper classes.

## Naming and Readability

- All class, method, and variable names must be descriptive and intention-revealing.
- Avoid vague names like data, info, helper, or temp.

## Scalability Mindset

- Always code as if someone else will scale this.
- Include extension points (e.g., protocol conformance, dependency injection) from day one.

## Avoid God Classes

- Never let one file or class hold everything (e.g., massive Screen, Hook, or Utils).
- Split into app/, hooks/, utils/, providers/, etc.
